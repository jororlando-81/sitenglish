    <h4>  Do you know how to use adjectives with prepositions like interested in or similar to? <h4>

            <li>My jacket is similar to yours.</li>

    <h1>  Grammar explanation  </h1>   
    
    <h4>Some adjectives go with certain prepositions. There are no grammatical rules for which preposition is
    used with which adjective, so it's a good idea to try to learn them together. To help you do this, write 
    new vocabulary in your notebook in a sentence or phrase.</h4>

    <h4>However, there are some patterns that can help you. Let's look at them first. Remember that a</h4> 
    <h4>preposition is followed by a noun or a gerund (-ing form).</h4>
